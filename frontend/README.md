# 🎉 Welcome to KanbanFlow!

Hey there! 👋

Ever felt like your to-do list is plotting against you? Or that your team’s sticky notes are multiplying when you’re not looking? I built **KanbanFlow** to bring a little order (and a lot of color) to the chaos of teamwork. It’s a real-time, collaborative Kanban board that’s as fun to use as it is useful. Whether you’re a productivity nerd or just trying to survive group projects, you’ll feel right at home here.

## 🚀 What Makes KanbanFlow Awesome?

- **Sign up, log in, and keep your stuff safe** (no more anonymous sticky notes!)
- **Modern Kanban board** with Todo, In Progress, and Done columns
- **Drag and drop tasks** like a boss
- **Real-time updates** (watch your teammates move cards live—it's like magic)
- **Activity log** so you always know who did what (and when)
- **Smart Assign**: let the app pick who gets the next task (admins only, sorry!)
- **Admin powers**: assign, delete, and manage users
- **Animated, colorful UI** (because productivity shouldn’t be boring)
- **Conflict handling** so nobody steps on each other’s toes
